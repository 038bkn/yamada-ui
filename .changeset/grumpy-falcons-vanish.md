"@yamada-ui/carousel": major

- Added `watchDrag`, `watchSlides`, `watchResize` callback functions.
- Props `speed` has been renamed to `duration`.
- Added `controlRef`. By using this ref, we can now access the logic inside the component.
- The type definition was updated with the version upgrade of `embla-carousel-react`.
